A    F#m   D  E  A

[Verse 1]
             A
When the night has come
F#m
   And the land is dark
            D         E              A
And the moon is the only light we'll see
          A
No, I won't be afraid
      F#m
No, I won't be afraid
           D            E           A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
                      A
So, darling, darling, stand by me
    F#m
Oh, stand by me
    D     E            A
Oh, stand, stand by me

Stand by me

[Verse 2]
         A
If the sky that we look upon
F#m
   Should tumble and fall
            D          E              A
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
          A
I won't cry, I won't cry
       F#m
No, I won't shed a tear
           D            E           A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
                      A
And darling, darling, stand by me
    F#m
Oh, stand by me
     D        E            A
Oh, stand now, stand by me

Stand by me

[Instrumental]
A    F#m   D  E  A    x2

[Chorus]
                      A
So, darling, darling, stand by me
    F#m
Oh, stand by me
     D               E
Oh, stand now, stand by me
      A
Stand by me

                                     A                 F#m
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh, stand by me
     D              E             A
Oh, stand now, oh, stand, stand by me

Em7  G  D  C  x2

[Verse 1]
Em7           G
Today is gonna be the day
       D                    C
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em7            G
By now you should've somehow
  D                 C
Realized what you gotta do
Em7               G               D
I don't believe that anybody feels
    C        Em7    G    D    C
The way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Em7          G
Backbeat the word was on the street
     D               C
That fire in your heart is out
Em7           G
I'm sure you've heard it all before
    D                C
But you never really had a doubt
Em7               G               D
I don't believe that anybody feels
    C        Em7    G    D    C
The way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
    C           D           Em7
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    C           D              Em7
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
C             D
There are many things that I would
G      D/F#     Em7
Like to say to you
    D           C
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
              C    Em7  G
Because maybe
                Em7           C    Em7  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me
    Em7      C    Em7  G    Em7
And after all
                 C    Em7  G    Em7
You're my wonderwall`

C                G
When I find myself in times of trouble
Am          F
Mother Mary comes to me
C                G              F  Em Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

C              G
And in my hour of darkness
         Am             F
She is standing right in front of me
C                G              F  Em Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
G                F           Em Dm C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
C                G
And when the broken hearted people
Am               F
Living in the world agree
C               G               F  Em Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be

C                G
For though they may be parted
           Am                F
There is still a chance that they will see
C               G               F  Em Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
G              F             Em Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be

Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
G                F           Em Dm C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be`
