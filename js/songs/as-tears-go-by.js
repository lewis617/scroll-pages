It is the evening of the da-ay

all I hear is the sound
G       G/F#       Em
of rain falling on the ground
C               D      D/A
I sit and watch as tears go b--y

It is the evening of the da-ay
G              A              C        D
I sit and watch the children pla-ay
C         D
doing things I used to do
G    G/F#    Em
they think are new
C               D      D/A
I sit and watch as tears go b--y
