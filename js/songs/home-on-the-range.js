[Verse 1]
   G                        C
Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
          G                    D
Where the deer and the antelope play
      G                   C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
         G             D         G
And the skies are not cloudy all day

[Chorus]
 D                G
Home home on the range
                                 D
Where the deer and the antelope play
       G                  C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
        G             D          G
And the skies are not cloudy all day

[Verse 2]
G                                 C
The Red Man was pressed from this part of the west
         G                   D
It's not likely he'll ever return
       G                        C
To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
    G          D               G
His flickering campfires still burn

[Chorus]
D                G
Home home on the range
                                D
Where the deer and the antelope play
      G                   C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
        G             D          G
And the skies are not cloudy all day

[Verse 3]
G                           C
How often at night when the heavens are bright
         G                         D
With the light from the glittering stars
       G                      C
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
         G       D             G
If their glory exceeds that of ours

[Chorus]
D                G
Home home on the range
                                D
Where the deer and the antelope play
      G                   C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
        G             D          G
And the skies are not cloudy all day

[Verse 4]
G                           C
Oh give me a land where the bright diamond sand
      G                  D
Flows leisurely down the stream
          G                        C
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along
       G         D        G
Like a maid in a heavenly dream

[Chorus]
D                G
Home home on the range
                                D
Where the deer and the antelope play
      G                   C
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
        G             D          G
And the skies are not cloudy all day
        G             D          G
And the skies are not cloudy all day`
