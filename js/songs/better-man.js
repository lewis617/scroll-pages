[Intro]
F Fsus4 F Fsus4

[Verse 1]
                 F
Send someone to love me
           Dm
I need to rest in arms
          Gm7
Keep me safe from harm
            C
In pouring rain

                 F
Give me endless summer
         Dm
Lord I fear the cold
            Gm7
Feel I'm getting old
           C
Before my time

[Chorus]
Dm                     C
As my soul heals the shame
         F                Dm
I will grow through this pain
           Gm7          C
Lord I'm doing all I can
                  F  Fsus4
To be a better man

[Verse 2]
                 F
Go easy on my conscience
            Dm
'Cause it's not my fault
             Gm7
I know I've been taught
              C
To take the blame

                 F
Rest assured my angels
       Dm
Will catch my tears
         Gm7
Walk me out of here
        C
I'm in pain

[Chorus]
Dm                     C
As my soul heals the shame
         F                Dm
I will grow through this pain
           Gm7          C
Lord I'm doing all I can
                F
To be a better man

[Bridge]
 Ab                                      Dbmaj7
Once you've found that lover You're homeward bound
         Cm7
Love is all around
         Fm
Love is all around

   Ab                       Dbmaj7
I know some have fallen On stony ground
          Gm Am Bb Dm C
But Love is all around

[Final Verse]
                 F
Send someone to love me
           Dm
I need to rest in arms
          Gm7
Keep me safe from harm
            C
In pouring rain

                 F
Give me endless summer
         Dm
Lord I fear the cold
            Gm7
Feel I'm getting old
           C
Before my time

[Final Chorus]
Dm                     C
As my soul heals the shame
         F                Dm
I will grow through this pain
           Gm7          C
Lord I'm doing all I can

To be a better man`
