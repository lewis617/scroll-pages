[Verse 1]
 
                E
You're just too good to be true
              Emaj7
Can't take my eyes off you
              E7
You'd be like heaven to touch
        A
I wanna hold you so much
              Am
At long last love has arrived
            E
And I thank God I'm alive
                F#              F#m
You're just too good to be true
              E
Can't take my eyes off you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
           E
Pardon the way that I stare
                Emaj7
There's nothing else to compare
             E7
The sight of you leaves me weak
                   A
There are no words left to speak
          Am
So if you feel like I feel
              E
Please let me know that it's real
                F#              F#m
You're just too good to be true
              E
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby, and if it's quite alright

I need you baby, to warm the lonely nights
           F#m    B7                 E   C#7#9
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
          F#m                   B7
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
          G#m7                C#m7
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay
           F#m               D6
And let me love you, let me love you

At long last love has arrived

And I thank God I'm alive
