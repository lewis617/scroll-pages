C#maj7    C7    Fm7    D#m7  G#7  C#maj7    C7    Fm7      x2

[Verse 1]
C#maj7        C7                Fm7
   I see the crystal raindrops fall
        D#m7    G#7    C#maj7
And the beauty of it all
            C7                Fm7
Is when the sun comes shining through

C#maj7            C7             Fm7
   To make those rainbows in my mind
       D#m7      G#7      C#maj7
When I think of you sometime
            C7                   Fm7
And I wanna spend some time with you

[Chorus]
         C#maj7      C7        Fm7     Em7  D#m7
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try
G#7       C#maj7     C7           Fm7
Just the two of us    (just the two of us)
         C#maj7      C7          Fm7     Em7   D#m7
Just the two of us,    building castles in the sky
G#7       C#maj7      C7         Fm7
Just the two of us,    you and I

[Verse 2]
C#maj7          C7                Fm7
   We look for love, no time for tears
       D#m7     G#7       C#maj7
Wasted water's all that is
             C7              Fm7
And it don't make no flowers grow

C#maj7                C7                Fm7
   Good things might come to those who wait
            D#m7       G#7       C#maj7
But not for those who wait too late
         C7            Fm7
We gotta go for all we know

[Chorus]
         C#maj7      C7        Fm7     Em7  D#m7
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try
G#7       C#maj7     C7           Fm7
Just the two of us    (just the two of us)
         C#maj7      C7               Fm7     Em7   D#m7
Just the two of us,    building them castles in the sky
G#7       C#maj7      C7         Fm7
Just the two of us,    you and I

[Verse 3]
C#maj7         C7                Fm7
   I hear the crystal raindrops fall
       D#m7    G#7       C#maj7
On the window down the hall
         C7                Fm7
And it becomes the morning dew

C#maj7           C7               Fm7
   And darling, when the morning comes
      D#m7     G#7      C#maj7
And I see the morning sun
        C7              Fm7
I wanna be the one with you

[Chorus]
         C#maj7      C7        Fm7     Em7  D#m7
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try
G#7       C#maj7     C7           Fm7
Just the two of us    (just the two of us)
         C#maj7      C7              Fm7     Em7   D#m7
Just the two of us,    building big castles way on high
G#7       C#maj7      C7         Fm7
Just the two of us,    you and I`
