(Play Softly - Piano)
[Capo on First]

          D          G               D
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
               D      G           A             A
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
             Bm        G                 D       G
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
            D      A              D
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

[Chorus]
             Bm     G                 D            A
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
              Bm     G              D         A
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
         Bm       G                  D     G
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
             D       A               D
You raise me up to more than I can be.

[Solo]

Slight Crescendo to Forte
Repeat [Capo on 3rd]
             Bm     G                 D            A
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
              Bm     G              D         A
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
         Bm       G                  D     G
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
             D       A               D
You raise me up to more than I can be.

Fortissimo
Repeat (x2) [Capo on 4th]
             Bm     G                 D            A
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
              Bm     G              D         A
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
         Bm       G                  D     G
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
             D       A               D
You raise me up to more than I can be.

Decrescendo to piano then pianissimo
