D Dmaj7/F# Bm A
 
 
[Verse 1]
D             Dmaj7/F#
Yesterday has been and gone
Bm                A
Tomorrow will I find the sun
G               Asus4  A
or will it rain?
D             Dmaj7/F#
Everybody's having fun
Bm                   A
except me, I'm the lonely one
G                  Asus4
I live in shame
 
 
[Chorus]
A     D     Dmaj7/F#     Bm   A
I sa-ay; goodbye to romance
G                   Asus4
Goodbye to friends
A        D
I tell ya
   Dmaj7/F#   Bm       A
Goodbye to all the past
G                          Asus4           A
I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end
 
 
[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
D                       Dmaj7/F#
I've been the King, I've been the clown
Bm                      A
Now, broken wings can't hold me down
G               Asus4  A
I'm free again
D                   Dmaj7/F#
The jester with the broken crown
Bm                  A
It won't be me, this time around,
G               Asus4
to love in vain
 
 
[Chorus]
A     D     Dmaj7/F#     Bm   A
I sa-ay; goodbye to romance
G                   Asus4
Goodbye to friends
A        D
I tell ya
   Dmaj7/F#   Bm       A
Goodbye to all the past
G                          Asus4           A
I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end
 
 
[Bridge]
D Dmaj7/F# Bm A
 
Em                                         Asus4
And I feel the time is right, although I know
               A
That you just might say to me:
D
"What you gonna do
D
What you gonna do"
Em
But I have to take this chance
              Asus4         A
Goodbye to friends and to romance
D
And to all of you
D
And to all of you
D
Come on, now

[Chorus]
A     D     Dmaj7/F#     Bm   A
I sa-ay; goodbye to romance
G                   Asus4
Goodbye to friends
A        D
I tell ya
   Dmaj7/F#   Bm       A
Goodbye to all the past
G                          Asus4           A

[Verse 3]
            D            Dmaj7/F#       Bm
And the weather's lookin' fine and I think the sun
A       G         Asus4 A
Will shine again
      D                   Dmaj7/F#
And I feel I've cleared my mind
         Bm       A        G       Asus4
All the past is left behind again
 
 
[Chorus]
A     D     Dmaj7/F#     Bm   A
I sa-ay; goodbye to romance
G                   Asus4
Goodbye to friends
A        D
I tell ya
   Dmaj7/F#   Bm       A
Goodbye to all the past
G                          Asus4           A
I guess that we'll meet, we'll meet in the end`
